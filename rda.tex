\abstract{The topography and continental configuration of East Asia favor the year-round existence of zonal storm tracks that extend thousands of miles from eastern China into the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

\section{Introduction} 

 	Eastern China receives about 60\% of its precipitation from May to August via the East Asian summer monsoon. The period of peak rainfall lasting from early June to mid-July is called ``Meiyu season'' (lit. ``plum rains,'' referring to the spectacular growth of plum blossoms in central China with the onset of heavy rains). During this time, heavy rainfall occurs in zonal bands resulting from frontal synoptic conditions (the ``Meiyu Front''). The rainfall climatology of Japan and Korea also features similar time periods, known as Baiu and Changma respectively. The contribution from these rainbands leads to a rainfall seasonality in the East Asian monsoon that is unique relative to other monsoon circulations \citep{Ding2005}. More generally, rainbands are a year-round feature of Asian rainfall, attributed to forced downstream convergence by the Tibetan Plateau\citep{Molnar2010}. The contribution of banded rainfall to seasonal and yearly totals has never been quantified across a large sample of days.
		
	We present a recursive image processing algorithm, the Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA), which locates one or more rainbands in a daily precipitation map and quantifies their attributes. By applying this algorithm to aggregated weather station data from APHRODITE, we create a 57-year (1951-2007) daily database of rainband occurrences in China. Previous studies have investigated the statistics of the Meiyu front on decadal and even centennial timescales \citep{Chen2004,Ge2008,Xu2009}, but to our knowledge no previous author has compiled a multi-decadal daily catalog of events.
	
	 All rainfall on each day is further characterized as belonging to a rainband (``banded'' rainfall) or outside of any band (``local'' rainfall). We believe that this classification scheme ultimately corresponds to different causal mechanisms: Banded rainfall reflects large-scale convergence due to frontal conditions, whereas local rainfall likely results from mechanisms with shorter length scales such as convective self-buoyancy and orographic rainfall. We cannot rule out that multiple mechanisms are capable of forming rainbands. For instance, westward propagating cyclone tracks in late summer sometimes produce zonal bands. However, in \citep{Day2015}, it was shown that the typical radius of East Asian summer monsoon storms is only 200-300 km, while mean yearly rainband length is about 1200 km (Figure~\ref{hov}). Thus, our data show that storms propagate zonally across large distances at all times of year in East Asia. We attribute this notable feature to persistent frontal conditions that favor large-scale convergence.
	 
	 The length of our data set allows us to examine potential decadal changes. It has been broadly reported that China experienced a long-term shift in the distribution of rainfall known as the ``South Flood-North Drought'' (SFND), where the Yangtze River Valley witnessed an uptick in flooding and northern China an increased susceptibility to drought beginning in the 1980 \citep{Hu1997,Gong2002,Nigam2013}. A permanent change would have major humanitarian impacts on densely-populated eastern China, where a sizable fraction of the population depends on agriculture for subsistence. Northern China already suffers from substantial depletion of freshwater resources along with increasing demand \citep{Currell2012,Gleeson2012}. The Chinese government has embarked on a project to reroute water from the Yangtze River to northern China, the South-North Water Transfer Project (\textit{nanshui beidiao gongcheng}), which is expected to become the most expensive hydraulic engineering project ever undertaken and will entail massive human and environmental impact \citep{Berkoff2003,Magee2011}. Under such circumstances, it is vital to understand whether this pattern will strengthen under global warming, or represents only a temporary deviation from the mean. 
	 
	 Past authors have attributed these decadal rainfall changes to a combination of direct anthropogenic forcing, internal variability, and the influence of other leading modes of natural variability \citep{Zhou2009}. \citet{Xu2001} speculated that sulfate aerosols could be culpable for the SFND, while \citet{Menon2002} found instead through a suite of simulations that the addition of black carbon aerosols in realistic concentrations reproduce the observed SFND pattern. \citet{Li2010,Zhao2010} instead emphasized the influence of global warming on East Asian monsoon progression. \citet{Ding2008} suggested from looking at over hundred years of rainfall records that the East Asian summer monsoon features several modes of multi-decadal internal variability. The SFND has also been linked more directly to larger-scale decadal changes in Pacific and Indian Ocean SSTs \citep{Gong2002}, ENSO teleconnections \citep{Xie2010} or in the Northern Annular Oscillation (NAO) \citep{Xin2006,Yu2007}, which themselves have likely responded to anthropogenic forcing. Another shift has been reported during the early 1990s \citep{Wu2010,Zhang2014}, featuring a spatial pattern distinct from the SFND, and possibly a different origin.
	 
	 By comparing the time periods 1951-1979 versus 1980-2007, and also 1980-1993 versus 1994-2007, our rainband catalog allows us to show whether changes in rainfall were induced by changes in banded rainfall, local rainfall or both. Furthermore, changes in banded rainfall are broken down into the component due to changes in frequency, and a component due to changes in event intensity. Our results quantify decadal rainfall change in eastern China in novel fashion. We demonstrate the value of our new database by testing various China rainfall metrics used in other publications, and showing that they can only reproduce a limited fraction of our findings. Our results may also
	  provide insight into possible causative mechanisms. For instance, we expect global warming to have a different ``fingerprint'' in rainfall frequency and intensity changes\citep{Trenberth2011a,Pendergrass2014b} compared with the impacts of an increase in aerosols \citep{Wang2016}.
	 
	 In the following text, Chapter 2 describes the source APHRODITE data for rainfall and then details functionality of the RDA algorithm. Chapter 3 details the statistical methods used to evaluate significance. In Chapter 4, we present a climatology of rainbands (frequency and intensity). Chapter 5 investigates how previously reported changes in eastern China rainfall, one at the end of the late 1970s (the ``South Flood-North Drought'') and another during the early 1990s, are represented in our data set. Finally, in the conclusion, we propose potential applications of our data to understanding East Asian monsoon dynamics.
	 
\section{Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA) Functionality}

\subsection{Overview}

	For each day from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007 (20,819 days total), RDA determines whether a rainband exists inside the window of 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N, a region hereafter referred to as ``East China.'' A rainband is defined as a continuous chain of rainfall maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$ spanning at least 5$^{\circ}$ of longitude. If a rainband exists, its properties are calculated including latitude, intensity, tilt, length and width, as well as a ``quality score'' $Q$, defined as the fraction of daily total East China rainfall falling within the band. Fits with poor $Q$ are not classified as bands. We also test for the existence of two rainbands on a single day, an arrangement commonly found in August and September. In such a case, the first and second fitted rainbands are referred to as ``primary'' and ``secondary'' rainbands respectively. A description of algorithm functionality in greater detail follows.
	
	We cannot distinguish between the mechanisms that supply rainfall. Any storm that propagates zonally over the course of a day will be interpreted as a rainband, regardless even of whether it propagates westward or eastward. However, from observation, storms reaching East China during the rainiest months of the East Asian summer monsoon are predominantly westerly \citep{Day2015}. Therefore, we expect that RDA detects similar types of rainfall events from one summer to the next, allowing for meaningful analysis of decadal changes.  
	
\subsection{APHRODITE Rainfall}

	The APHRO\_MA\_V1101 product from APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Water Resources) includes 57 years (1951-2007) of continental daily rainfall (PRECIP product) on a .25$^{\circ} \times .25^{\circ}$ grid over 60$^{\circ}$-150$^{\circ}$E and 15$^{\circ}$S-55$^{\circ}$N \citep{Yatagai2012}, as well as a daily map of reporting weather stations on the same grid (RSTN product). Values are reported over land only. We focus on the subregion inside of 105$^{\circ}$E-123$^{\circ}$E and 20$^{\circ}$N-40$^{\circ}$N where rainbands are known to occur frequently, especially during Meiyu season. The network of stations remains dense (100-200km spacing) through time, such that rainbands are clearly resolved and we are not concerned about potential artifacts from changes in station density. APHRODITE's resolution cannot capture some features visible in TRMM satellite data \citet{Xu2009}, but its length allows for the study of decadal change. We use the words ``rainfall'' and ``precipitation'' interchangeably in the rest of this work since most precipitation consists of rain, although snow is common in northeastern China during winter.
	
\subsection{Finding Rainbands with a Convergent Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Given a daily map of East China rainfall (105-123$^{\circ}$E, 20-40$^{\circ}$N) at $.25^{\circ} \times .25^{\circ}$ resolution, the maximum rainfall intensity $int_{max}$ and its latitude $lat_{max}$ are recorded at each longitude. If there exists a continuous chain of maxima spanning $5^{\circ}$ of longitude (20 points in a row) where $int_{max}$ exceeds 10 mm day$^{-1}$, we proceed to step 2 and attempt a rainband fit (Figure~\ref{fig:f32}a). Otherwise, there is no rainband and no fit is attempted for that day (Figure~\ref{fig:f32}b).
	
	\item A weighted least-squares linear regression of $lat_{max}$ using $int_{max}$ as weighting approximates the position of the rainband with a straight line (a reasonable assumption from observation). To encourage convergence, the weight of outlying maxima is set to zero. An outlier is defined as any maximum where $lat_{max}$ is over $5^{\circ}$ of latitude away from  $\left<lat_{max}\right>$, the centroid of $lat_{max}$ weighted by $int_{max}$\footnote{In rare cases with two rainbands of roughly equal strength that are well-separated in latitude, the centroid of precipitation may lie midway between the bands such that all maxima will be thrown out as outliers. To avoid this scenario, we verify after removing outliers that

%% FOOTNOTE

	 \sum\limits_{long} weights > 200 \mathrm{\ mm\ day}^{-1}
	\end{equation*}
	
 	When this condition is failed, which can only occur when too many of our maxima have been discarded, we return to step 1 and find maxima inside a subwindow with latitude range of 20$^{\circ}$N-$\left<lat_{max}\right>$ or $\left<lat_{max}\right>$-40$^{\circ}$N, depending on which half of our domain has a longer chain of maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$. The remaining steps of our algorithm are applied as usual. The search for a secondary rainband and calculation of quality scores are performed over the whole East China window (20$^{\circ}$N-40$^{\circ}$N).}, calculated as %%END FOOTNOTE

	\begin{equation*}
	\left<lat_{max}\right>=\frac{\sum_{long} lat_{max}*int_{max}}{\sum_{long} int_{\max}}
	\end{equation*}

	\item A recursive algorithm converges from this initial fit to a best estimate of rainband position. In each iteration, we find a new set of maxima within \textit{k} degrees of the previous best fit line, and again perform a weighted linear fit of the maxima (Figure~\ref{fig:f33}a). $k$ is progressively decreased with each iteration from $5^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments, and then from $2^{\circ}$ to $.25^{\circ}$ by $.25^{\circ}$ increments repeating each width $k$ twice in a row (Figures~\ref{fig:f33}b-c). The fit obtained in the final iteration is taken as our best estimate (Figure~\ref{fig:f33}d).
	
	\item We define the ``quality score'' $Q$ as the fraction of daily total East China rainfall (the sum of all rainfall inside of 105-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N) that falls within $2.5^{\circ}$ degrees of the best estimate line (Figure~\ref{fig:f34}b). Other rainband properties are calculated as follows:
	
	 \begin{enumerate}
	 
	 	\item \textit{Latitude}: The latitude of the best fit line at 115$^{\circ}$E. 
	 
	 	\item \textit{Intensity}: Mean rainfall of all ``rainband points'' (points along the best fit line where daily rainfall exceeds 5 mm day$^{-1}$).
	 
	 	\item \textit{Length}: Total number of rainband points (units of degrees longitude)
	 
	 	\item \textit{Width}: Mean distance between half-maxima ($int_{max}$/2) on either side of each rainband point (units of degrees latitude).
	 
	 \end{enumerate}
	
	\item After finding a primary rainband, we check for the existence of a secondary rainband by removing all \textit{banded rainfall} associated with the primary band from the daily rainfall map. \textit{Banded rainfall} is defined as all rainfall falling within 4$^{\circ}$ of a rainband axis and any other adjacent points where rainfall exceeds 10 mm day$^{-1}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:f35}a for an example). After removing primary rainband rainfall, we reapply the continuous maximum criterion from step 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:f35}b). If passed, steps 2-4 are repeated to find a best estimate for the position of the secondary rainband, and its attributes calculated.
	
	\item If a secondary rainband is found, two additional \textit{conditional} quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are calculated. $Q_1$ is the fraction of total daily East China rainfall that fell within $2.5^{\circ}$ degrees of the primary rainband \textit{after removing all rainfall associated with the secondary rainband} (effectively the $Q$ score if the secondary rainband didn't exist). Likewise, $Q_2$ is the $Q$ score of the second rainband \textit{after removing all rainfall from the primary rainband}. An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f34}d.		
	
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Quality Control}

	After running the algorithm for all 20,819 days from 1 January 1951 to 31 December 2007, we obtained 11,228 days with at least one rainband and 1,116 days with two rainbands. Subsequently, we apply a quality control (QC) algorithm to eliminate days with poor fit, based on the quality scores $Q$, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ as well as the ``Taiwan fraction'' $TW$, defined as the percentage of daily total East China rainfall falling over the island of Taiwan (roughly 120-$122^{\circ}$E and 22-$26^{\circ}$N). Rainband fits are deemed successful if they satisfy the following two criteria:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item $TW < 20\%$. If $TW > 20\%$, the day's fit is thrown out (238 cases total, 2.1\% of total fits). Such days are dominated by tropical storms reaching Taiwan and do not exhibit a strong rainband (example shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f34}a).  
	
	\item The quality scores of the fit must meet either of the two following benchmarks:
	
	\begin{enumerate} 
	
	\item If $Q>.6$, the fit is deemed successful (7,522 days, 67.0\% of total fits; Figure~\ref{fig:f34}b). If $Q_2$ is also greater than .6, the day will be classified as a double rainband day (Type I double rainband; 232 cases). 3.1\% of days where $Q>.6$ also achieve $Q_2>.6$.
		
	\item If $Q<.6$, the fit is discarded unless two rainbands are detected and both $Q_1 > .6\mathrm{\ \textbf{and}\ }Q_2 > .6$ (where again $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are \textit{conditional} quality scores as defined above). In such cases, the presence of multiple rainbands of similar intensity initially obscures the goodness of fit (Figure~\ref{fig:f34}d). Such days are also classified as double rainband days (Type II double rainband; 466 cases).
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	If neither criterion 2a nor 2b is satisfied, the fit is thrown out (Figure~\ref{fig:f34}c).
	
\end{enumerate}	

	The use of conditional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ adds 466 double rainband fits (6.2\% of all successful fits) that would otherwise have been missed due to $Q<.6$. 33.2\% of double rainband days are Type I ($Q>.6$) and 66.8\% Type II ($Q<.6$) as defined above. Double rainbands are more common during certain months, particularly July-September. Tables~\ref{tab:t31}-~\ref{tab:t33} contain detailed results of the application of RDA to years 1951-2007 in APHRODITE. The entire catalog is publicly available on the author's website.

\subsection{Rainfall Types}
	
	RDA allows us to classify all rainfall on each day as either \textit{banded} (falls within a rainband) or \textit{local}. \textit{Banded} rainfall consists of all rainfall falling within 4$^{\circ}$ of a rainband axis and any other adjacent points where rainfall exceeds 10 mm day$^{-1}$, the same definition as in step 5 of the recursive algorithm above. An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f35}a. Rainfall on each of the 20,819 available days was partitioned into its banded and local components. This allows us to determine what fraction of rainfall at each point in East China is supplied via banded rainfall (Figure~\ref{fig:frontpct}). We also test for the significance of decadal changes in banded and local rainfall separately (Figure~\ref{fig:type_decadal}). These results are discussed below, and data publicly available as detailed in the Acknowledgements section.
	
\section{Methods of Analysis}	

\subsection{Alternative Metrics of China Rainfall}

Since the RDA method is complex, we must justify its use by proving that it supplies information about China rainfall beyond what simpler metrics can provide. We define a suite of potential daily rainfall metrics as follows: 

\begin{itemize}

	\item $M_1$ - Latitude of maximum rainfall;
	
	\item $M_2$ - Intensity-weighted centroid of daily rainfall latitude;
	
	\item $M_3$ - Intensity of maximum rainfall over China (100-123$^{\circ}$E and 20-40$^{\circ}$N);
	
	\item $M_4$ - Area-averaged intensity of China rainfall; 
	
	\item $M_5$ - Area-averaged intensity of North China rainfall (107.5-125$^{\circ}$E and 37-42$^{\circ}$N); 
	
	\item $M_6$ - Area-averaged intensity of South China rainfall (107.5-122.5$^{\circ}$E and 27-33$^{\circ}$N); 
	
	\item $M_7$ - \% of days where $M_5$ exceeds 1 mm day$^{-1}$ (\textit{frequency} of North China rainfall);
	
	\item $M_8$ - \% of days where $M_6$ exceeds 1 mm day$^{-1}$ (\textit{frequency} of South China rainfall).
	
\end{itemize}

 The definitions of the North China and South China regions are the same as in \citet{Yu2010}. A seasonal climatology of each metric is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:met_climo}, and mean values during different seasons listed in Tables~\ref{tab:t35} and \ref{tab:t36} for the periods 1951-1979 and 1980-2007, with significant changes between the two time periods demarcated. In general, the changes in these metrics are fewer and less discernible than those revealed by the use of RDA.
 
 \subsection{Temporal Autocorrelation}

	Fronts and rainbands tend to persist for several days. Therefore, rainfall amounts and front attributes on successive days are not fully independent observations, which reduces the effective number of degrees of freedom of these time series. This temporal autocorrelation must be accounted for in calculations of statistical significance such as estimating the $p$-value of a change in rainband frequency between two time periods. In this particular case, we use the analytic formula for a Bernoulli process (applicable for any time series where observations are binary) with effective number of degrees of freedom $n=\frac{N}{\tau}$ for number of days $N$ and decorrelation time $\tau$ given by

\begin{equation*}
\tau=1+2\sum_{k=1}^m \rho(k)
\end{equation*}

	where $\rho(k)$ is the autocorrelation function of rainband existence with lag $k$ \citep{VonStorch1999}. We calculate $\tau$ using a maximum lag of $m=10$ days. The yearly mean decorrelation timescale of rainband frequency is found to be $\tau = 1.81$ after removing the seasonal cycle. This value is used to calculate significance of changes in Figure 3b. The standard deviation and $p$-values of rainband frequency changes in Tables~\ref{tab:t35} and~\ref{tab:t37} use seasonal values of $\tau$ calculated in \ref{tab:t34}. Similarly, Table~\ref{tab:t311} shows the $\tau$ of alternative metrics of China rainfall, which is then used to calculate the significance of decadal changes in Table~\ref{tab:t312}. $\tau$ is also used to select block length for moving blocks bootstrap tests, as described below.
 
\subsection{Significance of Changes: Bootstrapping Algorithms}

	Observations of rainband latitude and intensity during a given time period obey unknown distributions. Therefore, we require non-parametric tests to estimate the standard deviation of their mean and the significance of changes in mean. We employ bootstrapping with and without replacement (the latter also known as a permutation test), well-established techniques that estimate quantities of interest by constructing synthetic distributions with random sampling of original data \citep{Good2005}. We use bootstrapping with replacement to calculate the standard deviation of means (Tables~\ref{tab:t34},~\ref{tab:t36} and~\ref{tab:t38}). We focus on changes in front attributes between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 (Tables~\ref{tab:t35} and~\ref{tab:t36}), and also repeat our methodology for 1979-1993 versus 1994-2007 (Tables~\ref{tab:t37} and~\ref{tab:t38}). $p$-values listed are from permutation testing with 10,000 iterations; the results of bootstrapping with and without replacement are very similar.
	
	The bootstrap must be adapted for time series featuring temporal autocorrelation. In such time series, a single anomalous weather event will persist over several days, and a bootstrap method will tend to exaggerate the significance of differences between the two original distributions. To avoid this scenario, we use a \textit{moving blocks bootstrap} test, described for instance in \citet{Singh2014}. This technique is identical to bootstrapping with replacement except that samples are drawn in continuous blocks of length $n$ that preserve the time structure of the original data set. Block length is chosen based on decorrelation time scale $\tau$. The autocorrelation of daily rainfall in China is approximately $\tau =2-3$ days, and therefore the significance estimates in Figure~\ref{fig:hov}a use a moving blocks bootstrap with block length of 2 days and 2000 iterations. The calculation of significance of change in alternative China rainfall statistics $M_1-M_6$ (Table~\ref{tab:t312}) uses the $\tau$ of each statistic in each season (Table~\ref{tab:t311}) rounded to the nearest integer as block length. In general, a choice of block lengths between 2 and 5 days leads to similar results. Our MATLAB code for the permutation test and the moving blocks bootstrap is included in the appendix.
	
	A moving blocks bootstrap cannot be used for time series with gaps. Therefore, we use a permutation test to estimate the significance of changes in mean latitude and intensity of rainbands between time periods (Tables~\ref{tab:t36} and~\ref{tab:t38}). These latter results are verified with Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, two methods which estimate the significance of shifts in distribution between two sample. These tests are described below.
	
\subsection{Significance of Changes in Distribution}

In addition to gauging the significance of changes in mean, we can also test the probability that two samples were drawn from the same distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests each define a test statistic based on the largest difference between the observed probability distribution of two samples. Similar to a $t$-test, the value of this test statistic can be translated into a $p$-value. We first define the \textit{empirical distribution function} $F_1(x)$ and $F_2(x)$ of each sample. All $n$ observations in each sample are ordered as $\left\{X_1 < ... < X_n\right\}$, after which $F(x)$ is calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
	F(x) =& \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I_{[-\infty,x]} (X_i) \\
	I_{[-\infty,x]} =& 
	\begin{cases}
   		 1 & \text{if } X_i \leq x\\
    		0 & \text{otherwise} \\
    	\end{cases}
\end{align}

 The K-S test statistic $D$ is then defined as the maximal distance between the two empirical distribution functions:

\begin{equation}
	D=\max_{all\ x} |F_{1}(x)-F_{2}(x)|
\end{equation}

$D$ can then be inverted to derive a $p$-value. The Anderson-Darling (A-D) test statistic $A^2$ resembles $D$, but is formulated to be more sensitive to the tails of the distribution:

\begin{equation}
	A^2 = -n-S \,,
	\mathrm{where}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	S=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{2i-1}{n}\left[\ln(F(X_i)) + \ln\left(1-F(X_{n+1-i})\right)\right].
\end{equation}

$A^2$ can likewise be translated into a $p$-value. The K-S and A-D tests cannot be used if values are repeated within samples, because $D$ and $A^2$ are then undefined. We solve this problem by using bootstrap versions of these tests. Bootstrap K-S and A-D tests were performed as tests in R with 10,000 iterations. The significance of changes in the distribution of rainband latitude and intensity are presented in Tables~\ref{tab:t313} and~\ref{tab:t314}. Both tests produce fairly similar results.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Climatology}

\subsubsection{Rainbands}

	We compile our daily rainband catalog into a 57-year daily climatology (1951-2007). Abrupt climatological shifts occur simultaneously in both rainfall and rainband climatology. We define 5 periods of distinct behavior as demarcated in Figure~\ref{fig:hov}, with the Pre-Meiyu, Meiyu and Post-Meiyu equivalent to the three stages of Meiyu rainfall described in \citet{Ding2005}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The Spring Rains (days 60-120, March 1-April 30), previously studied in \citet{Tian1998}, marked by frequent but relatively weak rainbands (47\% occurrence, 20 mm day$^{-1}$ mean);

\item Pre-Meiyu season (days 121-160, May 1-June 9), during which rainfall and front intensity steadily increase (56\% occurrence, 25.5 mm day$^{-1}$ mean);

\item Meiyu season (days 161-200, June 10-July 19) when a remarkable 7-degree northward shift in mean rainband latitude occurs over the course of several weeks, and rainband frequency and intensity peaks (66\% occurrence, 28.3 mm day$^{-1}$ mean); 

\item Post-Meiyu season (days 201-273, July 20-September 30), when rainbands are less common than during the Spring Rains (42\% occurrence) but double rainbands occur more frequently (28\% chance of observing a secondary rainband if a primary rainband is observed); 

\item The Fall Rains (days 274-320, October 1-November 16), when mean rainband latitude shifts back southward from its northern maximum of 30$^\circ$N and rainband frequency decreases to just 27\%. 

\end{enumerate}

	The total number of rainband counts as well as the mean and standard deviation of rainband frequency, latitude and intensity during each time period are presented in Table~\ref{tab:t34}. These results are comparable with the frontal event catalog of \citet{Xu2009}, who analyzed Meiyu rainbands in TRMM data for 1998-2007 and found a similar date for the northward transition of the Meiyu front. 

	The yearly progression of precipitation over eastern China is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hov}a, longitudinally averaged over $100-123^\circ$E with a 5-day running mean, similar to \citet{Ding2005}. Unlike other monsoonal regions, which tend to be very dry in winter \citep{Wang2002}, Eastern China receives about 40\% of yearly precipitation between September and April. Though these time periods are chosen subjectively, we also reproduce our analysis in the form of Hovm\"oller plots of climatology and decadal differences, which confirm our analysis.
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:hov}b shows a Hovm\"oller diagram of the probability of rainband occurrence at each latitude, including both primary and secondary rainbands. The transition from Pre-Meiyu to Meiyu and from Meiyu to Post-Meiyu both entail a rapid northward migration in rainfall (Figure~\ref{fig:hov}b) and abrupt changes in rainband statistics (Figure~\ref{fig:hov}b). The onset of the Meiyu is marked by a climatological jump both in rainband frequency and intensity around day 160 (June 9) that persists for 20 days when rainbands are concentrated between 26$^\circ$ and 30$^\circ$N. Yet by day 200 (July 19), this same region is less likely than any other latitude to feature a rainband, featuring roughly an 80\% local decline in rainband frequency and a decline in total rainfall from 7.6 mm day$^{-1}$ (days 161-180 mean) to 4.1 mm day$^{-1}$ (days 201-220 mean).
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:hov}c shows the probability of rainband occurrence and mean intensity on each day. Frontal rainbands over China can appear in any month, with their probability of occurrence and intensity maximizing in late June (80\% probability of occurrence, mean intensity of 31 mm day$^{-1}$) and minimizing in January (10\% probability occurrence, mean intensity of 12 mm day$^{-1}$). Rainbands are generally more probable and stronger during spring than in fall, and the intensification of rainband activity during the Meiyu and abrupt northward jump have no counterpart in the Fall Rains. The causes of this seasonal asymmetry merit further study. Some periods of heavy rainfall, in particular the August peak over southern China (over 10 mm day$^{-1}$ around 20$^{\circ}$N), do not correspond to a surge in rainband frequency. Instead, August and September are known as the months when northwestern Pacific typhoons reach mainland China \citep{Chen2007,Chen2011}. Figure~\ref{fig:hov}d shows mean rainband tilt and length, as well as the conditional probability of observing a secondary rainband given the presence of a primary rainband. 
	
\subsubsection{Banded vs Local Rainfall}	
	
	As described in detail in the Methods section, the RDA method allows us to classify all rainfall as either \textit{banded} or \textit{local}. Figure~\ref{fig:frontpct} shows that frontal rainfall constitutes at least 40\% of yearly total for all of mainland China east of 105$^\circ$E between 21$^\circ$N and 37$^\circ$N, over 60\% for most of central China, and up to 74\% in the vicinity of Jiangxi Province (28$^\circ$N, 116$^\circ$E). Thus, banded rainfall is an essential component of East China's yearly rainfall budget. In Figure~\ref{fig:type_climo}, we show a yearly climatology as well as seasonal means for the Pre-Meiyu, Meiyu and Post-Meiyu seasons. Banded rainfall constitutes the majority of rainfall during the Pre-Meiyu and Meiyu, but not the Post-Meiyu. 
	
%% consider adding hovmoller plot of climatological banded and local rainfall and total amounts - would make the point of the following paragraph very smoothly.

	Banded rainfall undergoes a dramatic progression previously evidenced in Figure~\ref{fig:hov}. In contrast, local rainfall retains a similar spatial configuration from season to season, with regions of local rainfall anchored by topography. For instance, a recurrent rainy band is visible along the southern edge of the South China/Qinling mountains. The Sichuan Basin also shows up as a locus of local rainfall; previous studies have shown that Sichuan experiences an unusual local rainfall climatology due to being directly in the lee of the Tibetan Plateau. Banded rainfall only constitutes a noticeable fraction of Taiwanese rainfall during the Pre-Meiyu. In fact, the term Meiyu season as used in Taiwan is typically centered around late May, although our study defines the Meiyu as June 10-July 19 \citep{Chen1994,Xu2009}.

\section{Decadal Changes}

\subsection{1980-2007 versus 1951-1979}

	China experienced a well-known ``South Flood-North Drought'' pattern of rainfall change between the mid- and late-\nth{20} century. The yearly mean change in rainfall rate between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007 over the region 100$^{\circ}$-142$^{\circ}$E and 20$^{\circ}$-48$^{\circ}$N is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sfnd}a. The South Flood-North Drought refers in particular to a meridional dipole of decadal rainfall change over eastern China (110$^{\circ}$-125$^{\circ}$E and 22$^{\circ}$-42$^{\circ}$N), where most of China's population resides. Pronounced local shifts are also visible in Taiwan, South Korea and parts of Japan. This work focuses on eastern China. Annual changes in northern China between 35$^{\circ}$-40$^{\circ}$N are significant at a 95\% confidence level, whereas changes in central and southern China are not. However, there are substantial changes in central and southern China rainfall during particular Meiyu stages, as discussed below.
	
	Using RDA to partition daily rainfall into its banded and local components, we can quantify how much changes in each type of rainfall have contributed to total change. Figure~\ref{fig:type_decadal} compares banded and local rainfall changes between the periods 1980-2007 and 1951-1979 over the whole year, and also during the Pre-Meiyu, Meiyu and Post-Meiyu seasons. Northern China has seen a major decrease in total rainfall (significant at a 99\% level), due in largest part to a decline in banded rainfall during the Post-Meiyu. Also, during the Pre-Meiyu season, a marked decrease in banded rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley ($p<.005$) is partially offset by a general increase in local rainfall across all of China, especially in the vicinity of Hunan, Guizhou and Chongqing Provinces (108$^\circ$-114$^\circ$E, 26$^\circ$-30$^\circ$N). Generally, banded and local rainfall changes are uncorrelated. Figure~\ref{fig:rain_diff_8007_5179} shows some significant changes also in winter rainfall, but the biggest rainy season changes are clearly due to changes in banded rainfall.

	Having isolated banded rainfall as the cause of decadal rainfall changes between 1980-2007 and 1951-1979, we can further attribute the change to a change in rainband frequency, intensity, or both. Figure \label{fig:hov_freq_int_8007_5179}) shows a H\"ovmoller plot of changes in frequency and intensity for the entire year, with only changes significant at a 95\% level shown. The most coherent significant changes in rainband frequency occur during the pre-Meiyu around 30$^\circ$N, and during the post-Meiyu around 35$^\circ$N, while there are no concerted changes in intensity during the warm rainy period (some are visible during the cold season). 
	
	Analyzing more closely by time period, we find that during the Pre-Meiyu (days 121-160), the average probability of observing a primary rainband has declined from $59.0\% \pm 2.0\%$ to $53.0\% \pm 2.1\%$ ($p=0.020$; Table~\ref{tab:t35} which we estimate as producing an XXX mm/day decline in rainfall. This Pre-Meiyu decrease in rainfall was previously identified by several authors \citep{Xin2006,Wang2009}. For the Post-Meiyu (days 201-273, or July 20-Sep 30), we specifically analyze rainbands occurring north of 27$^{\circ}$N, since rainbands in southern China during this time period are likely produced by typhoons, distinct from other mechanisms of rainband formation. Mean rainband latitude during 1951-1979 was $33.6^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .3^\circ$ for events north of 27$^{\circ}$N, versus $32.9^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .3^\circ$ during 1980-2007 ($p=.0003$; Table~\ref{tab:t36}). This shift remains significant if we do not restrict by front latitude ($p=.0048$). As a result, yearly rainfall has increased in central China even though Pre-Meiyu rainfall changes in that region are actually negative (Figure~\ref{fig:changes}a). Unlike \citet{Yu2010}, our catalog does not exhibit a \nth{20}-century decreasing trend in the intensity of Yangtze River region frontal rainbands during July-August. A significant southward shift in rainband latitude is also found for the whole year ($p=.0032$, Table~\ref{tab:t36}), but this signal is dominated by the Post-Meiyu shift.
	
	We verify these results by testing the significance of the changes in \textit{distribution} during 1980-2007 relative to 1951-1979 using bootstrap Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Dearing (AD) tests. Neither test captures the Pre-Meiyu decline in rainband frequency after 1979 since rainband latitude and intensity distributions remain similar. On the other hand, the Post-Meiyu southward shift in rainband latitude is found to be highly significant by both tests ($p<.001$). As before, no significant changes in rainband intensity are found between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007. This suggests that the estimates of significance from permutation testing are trustworthy.
	
	We have also compared metrics $M_1-M_8$ between 1980-2007 and 1951-1979 for the whole year and during each of the five Meiyu stages described above. Very few significant changes are found. The most notable change is a significant decrease in $M_5$ (North China Rainfall) for both the full year and Post-Meiyu, in concurrence with our findings in Figure~\ref{fig:type_decadal}. The highly significant decrease in central China rainfall during the Pre-Meiyu and increase during the Post-Meiyu are not captured by any of the alternative metrics, and the metrics also cannot reflect the observed zonal symmetry. We conclude that the use of RDA captures key features of the South Flood-North Drought that are not revealed by analyzing simpler metrics.
	
	In summary, the RDA method partitions Chinese rainfall into useful components, banded and local, each with distinct spatial and temporal distributions. Decadal changes in banded and local rainfall feature distinct spatial patterns. The South Flood-North Drought pattern of change between 1980-2007 and 1951-1979 can be attributed primarily to changes in banded rainfall, and more specifically to changes in the frequency of rainband occurrence.
	
\subsection{1980-1993 versus 1994-2007}
	
	We repeat the methodology described above with the set of years 1994-2007 versus 1980-1993, when past authors have reported a shift in South China rainfall \citep{Kwon2007,Wu2010,Yim2013}. Changes between these two time periods are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sfnd}b. The spatial pattern of change during 1980-1993 versus 1994-2007 is distinct from that shown in 1980-2007 versus 1951-1979. Specifically, the former resembles a zonally symmetric tripole, whereas the latter resembles more of a dipole pattern. These are known to be the leading modes of eastern China rainfall variability \citep{Day2015}.
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:rain_diff_9407_8093} shows that, unlike the 1980-2007 versus 1951-1979 comparison (Figure~\ref{fig:rain_diff_8007_5179}), significant summer changes occur in both banded and local rainfall, especially in July and August. Figure~\ref{fig:hov_freq_int_9407_8093}) furthermore shows that rainbands have generally intensified year round, and especially during the pre-Meiyu and Meiyu seasons over southern China. In particular, during Meiyu season, mean rainband latitude shifted southward from $30.0^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .4^\circ$ to $28.9^\circ \textrm{N} \pm .4^\circ\ (p=.0002)$ and the \textit{intensity} of rainbands also jumped from $27.3 \pm 1.1$ mm day$^{-1}$ to $29.8 \pm 1.1$ mm day$^{-1}\ (p=.9994)$, leading to increased rainfall over central and southern China. \citet{Zou2015} also found that China experienced a more intense Meiyu during the 1990s, as well as generally more severe rainfall events. Unlike the comparison between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007, rainband \textit{frequency} remained unchanged. Testing for the significance of the change in distribution, both the KS and AD tests found an altered distribution of intensity and latitude of rainbands during Meiyu season during 1994-2007 relative to 1980-1993 ($p<.001$ for both changes; Table~\ref{tab:t314}).
	
	In summary, the changes in rainfall between 1980-1993 and 1994-2007 are fundamentally different from the South Flood-North Drought pattern of changes between 1951-1979 and 1980-2007. In the former case, both banded and local rainfall experienced significant changes, and the change in banded rainfall was marked by a change in \textit{intensity}. During the latter, changes in the frequency of rainbands (without a change in intensity) led to decreases in banded rainfall. We propose that these two distinct kinds of decadal change reflect different forcing mechanisms, as explored in the conclusion.
	
\section{Conclusion}

	This work has aimed to quantify the role of frontal storms in the yearly rainfall climatology of eastern China. We used the Rainband Detection Algorithm (RDA), a recursive image processing algorithm, to compile a 57-year catalog of daily rainband occurrence over China and the properties of each event, such as latitude, intensity, tilt, width and length, all of which we have made available to other researchers. Over 50\% of yearly total precipitation is contributed by banded rainfall in most of eastern China. The progression of the East Asian summer monsoon in China is displayed in unprecedented fashion as a sequence of 5 stages of frontal precipitation, each with preferred position, frequency and strength of frontal rainfall. With approximate duration listed, these are: 1) the Spring Rains (March 1-April 30); 2) the Pre-Meiyu (May 1-June 9); 3) the Meiyu (June 10-July 19); 4) the Post-Meiyu (July 20-September 30) and 5) the Fall Rains (October 1-November 16). The climatological transitions from one period to the next are marked by abrupt changes in rainband frequency, latitude and intensity.
	
	The use of RDA on daily precipitation data runs the risk of conflating storms produced by different mechanisms in spite of our quality control screening. For instance, a zonally and rapidly propagating cyclone could be registered by RDA as an instance of banded rainfall, even though the direction of propagation is opposite that of a typical Meiyu event, and the causative dynamics very different. As the mean length of rainbands averages , we assert that it is generally successful in differentiating between storm tracks that are produced by large-scale synoptic conditions and local storms powered by orographic effects or self-buoyancy, whose spatial extent will be much more limited. The use of the available satellite record for the past couple of decades has revealed many further insights into the character of Meiyu storms and frontal rainfall in general \citep{Luo2009,Luo2011,Luo2013}.
	
	We are able to ascribe previously reported decadal rainfall change (the South Flood-North Drought) to modified rainband properties during particular rainfall stages. The years 1980-2007 were marked by a decline in banded rainfall relative to 1951-1979 (Figure~\ref{fig:type_decadal} and~\ref{fig:rain_diff_8007_5179}). Furthermore, these banded rainfall changes were induced by changes in rainband frequency during particular time periods: 1) A decrease in rainband frequency during the Pre-Meiyu ($p=.020$); 2) A southward shift in mean rainband latitude during the Post-Meiyu ($p=.0003$, permutation test; $p=.0001$, Anderson-Darling test). The first change led to a decrease in central China rainfall in May, while the second has been the principal contributor to the South Flood-North Drought trend in total yearly rainfall (Figure~\ref{fig:sfnd}a). Some other regions such as Taiwan, the Sichuan Basin or southernmost China \nth{20} century have also undergone significant changes in local rainfall.
	
	The existence of banded rainfall depends on unique attributes of the East Asian monsoon such as mechanical forcing by the Tibetan Plateau and southerly inflow of moisture due to zonal land-sea contrast \citep{Molnar2010,Chen2014}. We suggest that changes in banded rainfall reflect large-scale changes in East Asian summer monsoon dynamics at the end of the \nth{20} century.
	
	Abrupt transitions are shown between different Meiyu stages, each of which demonstrates a characteristic spatial distribution and intensity of rainbands. The resulting climatology may serve as a useful quantitative reference to other authors.
	
	We believe that we can use rainfall observations from the past half-century to obtain insight into how different mechanisms of rainfall have changed over the past few decades. In future work, we hope to show that changes in banded rainfall are tied to other observed changes in components of the East Asian monsoon.
	
	%%1979-1993 v 1994-2007 - conclusion paragraph.
	We also investigated a change in China rainfall between 1979-1993 and 1994-2007 reported by other authors. We find a highly significant uptick in the \textit{intensity} of rainbands during Meiyu season ($p=.0006$) as well as a southward shift in their mean latitude ($p=.0002$). The resulting mid-summer rainfall increase over the Yangtze River basin has increased the risk of flooding \citep{Gemmer2008}. We suggest that a different mechanism explains this surge in frontal rainfall severity than explains the 1951-1979/1980-2007 changes, which are characterized by frequency changes. A potential culprit are the aerosols produced during the industrialization and urbanization of East China beginning in 1979 with Deng Xiaoping's Revolutionary Reform and Opening (\textit{gaige kaifang}). Recent research highlights the potentially substantial impact of aerosols on atmospheric temperature and cloud properties across Asia \citep{Menon2002,Fan2012,Streets2013}. We suggest that the intensification of frontal storms during Meiyu season from 1994 to 2007 is linked to the rise in aerosols, and that they may be further impacted by the anticipated decrease of anthropogenic aerosols in the \nth{21} century \citep{Westervelt2015}.
		
	Our study also shows that the whole of Taiwan has experienced a deficit in rainfall during the end of the twentieth century. In particular, the south and eastern coast on the east of the Central Mountain Range saw the largest decrease during 1980-2007 versus 1951-1979 in all of East Asia according to APHRODITE (almost 2 mm day$^{-1}$). According to RDA, Taiwan receives relatively little banded rainfall (less than 40\%; Figure~\ref{fig:frontpct}), and the yearly aggregate depends substantially on typhoons and the locally favorable rainfall conditions in their wake \citep{Chen2011}. No consensus exists on the overall impact of global warming on tropical cyclone rainfall \citep{Wehner2015}. The suggestion has been made that tropical cyclone tracks in the vicinity of Taiwan have shifted due to global warming \citep{Wang2011}, but the shifts in question are only on the order of several hundred kilometers and may reflect natural variability instead \citep{Chan2006}. An upsurge in Taiwanese rainfall from tropical cyclones occurred at the beginning of the \nth{21} century \citep{Tu2009}, but further analysis suggested that it was unrelated to global warming \citep{Chang2013}. Thus, the \nth{20}-century decrease in Taiwanese rainfall remains to be explained. This example highlights the potential versatility of our rainband catalog in isolating different aspects of East Asian rainfall change.
	
	%% last paragraph - can hopefully use our data set in tandem with other sets to say something about east asian monsoon dynamic.
	Since the dynamics of rainfall in the East Asian monsoon remain a point of debate, centering around the roles and interplay of the tropospheric jet and Tibetan Plateau \citep{Molnar2010,Sampe2010,Chen2014}, we hope that our data can lead to objective tests for different mechanisms. Whereas understanding of tropical monsoons has progressed greatly via theoretical studies \citep{Plumb1992,Prive2007,Bordoni2008}, . It is known that the migration of the Meiyu front entails a series of large-scale circulation changes \citep{Chen2004}, and furthermore that anomalies in Meiyu front latitude produce corresponding rainfall anomalies \citep{Kosaka2011}. 
	
	%%% NEW OBSERVATIONS - still to be integrated into manuscript
	Although some authors have asserted that the trend from 1993 onward represents a continuation of the ``South Flood-North Drought'' pattern from 1980 onward, we instead point out that the spatial pattern of change is different, and corresponds to an uptick in the intensity of both banded and local rainfall, possibly reflecting a different causal mechanism.
	
	\citet{Choi2008} found that, on a daily scale, the concentration of PM10 aerosols (diameter less than 10 $\mu m$) is positively correlated with medium-to-heavy rainfall and negatively correlated with the occurrence of light rainfall. In addition, a modeling study by \citet{Wang2016} suggests that the largest impact on eastern China rainfall has come from the effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics, leading to a shift toward more intense precipitation. We suggest therefore that the increase in aerosols due to China's ultra-rapid industrialization during 1994-2007 relative to 1980-1993 may explain why both banded and local rainfall increased, and why banded rainfall changes are dominated by changes in intensity, and not frequency. Therefore, decadal changes in rainbands may serve as a fingerprint of the relative influence of global warming versus aerosol on the East Asian monsoon, as explored in \citet{Wang2016b,Wang2016c}. As they argue, since we expect the concentration of aerosols to generally decline in the \nth{21} century, this may even offer some measure of predictivity for future changes in banded rainfall, such as a return to rainband intensity values more typical of 1951-1979.
			
	It is essential to understand whether the South Flood-North Drought will persist under \nth{21}-century warming, or manifests an ephemeral decadal change. However, the CMIP5 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project) model suite contained in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) does not even agree on the sign of future summer rainfall changes in East Asia \citep{Christensen2011}. Some studies attribute the South Flood-North Drought to natural variability \citep{Zhang1999,Xin2006,Lei2014}, but \citet{Zhou2009} claimed that the South Flood-North Drought was distinct from other patterns of \nth{20}-century variability. Since regional climate projection in Asia poses such a challenge, the most hopeful approach may be to link the South Flood-North Drought with other large-scale climate changes that can be more reliably modeled and projected into the future. \citet{Zhao2010} previously suggested that the South Flood-North Drought was associated with the late \nth{20}-century rise in global mean surface temperature. We suggest a link with observed changes in the seasonal cycle of the East Asian jet, which we will elaborate in future work.
	
	can be seen as a modern version of the Jet Transition Hypothesis.
	
%% FRAGMENTS
In contrast, the sharp decrease in yearly rainfall in Taiwan is overwhelmingly due to changes in local rainfall. Banded rainfall only makes up 20-30\% of total rainfall on the island (Figure~\ref{fig:frontpct}).

Post-Meiyu rainbands are further categorized by whether they occur north or south of 27$^\circ$N, since events in that season have very different properties depending on latitude. We also list the decorrelation timescale $\tau_1$  and $\tau_2$ of primary and secondary fronts (units of days). Statistics are compiled using both primary and secondary rainbands, and are very close to results using primary rainbands alone, except during the Post-Meiyu period when secondary rainbands are common. Standard deviations for latitude and intensity are obtained by a permutation method with 10,000 iterations.}

%%FIGURE 1 - displaying continuous maximum criterion required to attempt rainband fit
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\noindent\includegraphics[width=40pc]{Figures/S1}
\caption{On each day, RDA first checks whether a continuous band of precipitation maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$ exists that spans over 5 degrees of longitude. If so, a rainband fit is attempted. In panels a and b, the latitude of maximum precipitation at each longitude is marked with a black X. The longest continuous chain of maxima exceeding 10 mm day$^{-1}$ is marked in red. a) 25 May 2007 - the continuous maximum criterion is met and a fit is attempted.  b) 11 June 2007 - although there is abundant rainfall in some locations, no band is visible and the continuous maximum criterion is failed. No fit is attempted.}

\caption{Display of the functionality of the recursive convergent fit. Dashed line shows estimated rainband position before each iteration and the solid lines indicate the window within we search for maxima. On 29 April 2007, a strong maximum in southernmost China skews our initial rainband fit (a), but the algorithm eventually converges on its true position via tighter windowing (d).}

\caption{A quality control algorithm is used to exclude poor fits. a) 18 August 2007 - Days with a high Taiwan fraction (here, corresponding to the passage of Typhoon Sepat) are excluded from our statistics. b) June 4 2007 - A high-quality fit is achieved. c) 17 April 2007 - Although a tentative fit is obtained, it explains the distribution of rainfall poorly and is therefore unsuccessful. d) 21 May 2007 (same day as Figure~\ref{fig:f35}) - An initial fit appears to be of poor quality ($Q<.6$). However, after finding a secondary rainband, we determine that conditional quality scores $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are sufficiently high, and the double rainband fit is successful.}

\caption{a) The first pass of the recursive fit algorithm converges on the strongest rainband, around 37$^{\circ}$N (defined as the ``primary rainband''). The \textit{banded rainfall} associated with the primary band is shaded with red hatchmarks. b) All banded rainfall from the primary band is removed, and we check for the presence of another rainband (a ``secondary rainband''), again using the continuous maximum criterion. When this criterion is satisfied, we find the secondary rainband's position with the recursive fit algorithm.}
