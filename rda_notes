-5d "secondary rainband" - front -> rainband
5c - "probability of primary front"

OR move entire secondary front line to panel c - won't intersect. Change captions accordingly.

-Tables in Pt. 2 need reformatting. How to make interesting?
Inez thinks that the tables may do better as bar graphs...reason being that you immediately see what has changed, and how. add whiskers to bars.



FOR FUTURE
-Inez still thinks Part 2 is potentially good enough to go to a nice journal.

-Can I say something interesting enough about joint changes in all of these atmospheric factors?

-do we have the diagnostic pieces to make an argument for the jetstream?

-fairly easy to download SST. "Suppose you chop the Pacific..." 20N to Bering Sea and some range of latitude.

-What if local rainfall is related to SSTs, and banded rainfall to the jet?

-Think about focusing on jet changes more robustly.

-Could even be arguing - which one matters more?

-boos paper on storms - the vortex-stretching stuff is wrong!
